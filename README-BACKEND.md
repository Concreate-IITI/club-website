# Concreate Club - Backend Implementation

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive backend system with MongoDB integration for managing team members through an admin dashboard. Here's what's been built:

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. **Database Models & Schema**

- **User Model**: Admin authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **TeamMember Model**: Complete team member profiles with skills and social links
- **Database Connection**: MongoDB connection with caching and error handling

#### 2. **Authentication System**

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token generation and verification
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware for admin-only access
- **Login/Logout API**: Complete authentication flow
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds

#### 3. **API Routes**

- **Public Team API** (`/api/team`): Get team members for public display
- **Admin Team Management** (`/api/admin/team`): CRUD operations for team members
- **Authentication APIs** (`/api/auth/*`): Login, logout, and user info
- **Individual Team Member API** (`/api/admin/team/[id]`): Edit/delete specific members

#### 4. **Admin Dashboard Pages**

- **Login Page** (`/login`): Beautiful, responsive admin login
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`): Overview with statistics and navigation

- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation for all forms
- **Sanitization**: XSS protection through input cleaning
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   The `.env.local` file is already configured with default values:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/conreate-app
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
   JWT_SECRET=another-super-secret-jwt-key
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@conreate.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
   ```

3. **MongoDB Setup**

   **Option A: Local MongoDB**

   - Install MongoDB locally
   - Start MongoDB service
   - The default URI will work

   **Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended)**

   - Create account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas)
   - Create a new cluster
   - Get connection string
   - Update `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local`

4. **Cloudinary Setup (For Image Upload)**

   **Required for image upload functionality:**

   - Create account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) (free tier available)
   - Get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret from dashboard
   - Update these values in `.env.local`:

   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   ```

   - See `CLOUDINARY-SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

5. **Create Admin User**

   ```bash
   npm run seed:admin
   ```

6. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. **Access Admin Dashboard**

- Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/login`
- Use credentials: `admin@conreate.com` / `admin123`
- You'll be redirected to the admin dashboard

### 2. **Manage Team Members**

- Click "Manage Team Members" on the dashboard
- Add new members with drag & drop image upload
- Edit existing members (includes image replacement)
- Toggle active/inactive status
- Delete members (with confirmation)
- Images are automatically optimized and stored in Cloudinary

### 3. **View Public Team Page**

- Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/team`
- See the beautiful team display with data from your database
- Members are automatically categorized by position
